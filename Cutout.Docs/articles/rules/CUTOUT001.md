# CUTOUT001 - Invalid Template

The template used is not valid in some way. This could be due to a syntax
error, or it could be that the template is not compatible with the Cutout
version of the liquid language.

The error will indicate the line number and position where the parser
encountered the issue. The user should review the template string and
resolve the problem.
